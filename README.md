# User Management App

## User Management App is a React-based application for managing and filtering user data. It allows users to view and search user records with a dynamic interface, using data fetched from a mock API.

Welcome to the User Management App! ðŸ‘‹ This project demonstrates my skills in React, Redux, and TypeScript. The app features a clean interface built with Tailwind CSS, a theme changer for a customizable user experience, and advanced filtering capabilities.

## Known Issues
Here are a few quirks in the User Management App that I'm aware of. Weâ€™re continuously working to improve the application, and your feedback is always welcome!

1. **Data Synchronization:**
   Occasionally, data updates may take a moment to reflect in the UI. Weâ€™re working on enhancing real-time synchronization.

2. **Responsive Layout:**
   Some elements may not align perfectly on very small or very large screens. Weâ€™re addressing these layout issues to ensure a seamless experience.

3. **Performance Tweaks:**
   In certain cases, the app may experience minor performance hiccups with a large number of users. Weâ€™re optimizing for smoother performance.

4. **Animation Display on Mobile Devices:**
   The current animations are triggered on hover, which does not translate well to mobile devices. We are working on adapting these animations to ensure they work seamlessly on touchscreens, improving the overall mobile user experience.
